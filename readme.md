============

*- gyromotion for the people, by the people -*

*An object-oriented library for gyromotion applications in plasma physics.*

Philosophy, purpose, and other useless matters:
-----------------------------------------------

Have you ever had a bright and promising idea about gyromotion in
plasmas that just faded away the moment you realised the amount of
non-trivial, tedious, unrewarding, non-physics details you would have to
implement before you could get a simple glimpse over the results?

`gyronimo` was designed to address this problem. It provides a library
of objects that take care of most tedious tasks in gyromotion
simulations, allowing developers to quickly implement and test their
ideas in order to understand if further work and optimisation really
worth the trouble. Built over object-oriented programming concepts like
inheritance, polymorphism, and specialisation, `gyronimo` provides
abstract algorithms to many tasks that developers may take advantage of,
either by employing ready-to-use objects or by deriving new ones adapted
to their own needs, in order to quickly finish a "working" workflow. In
a later stage, derived objects and procedures may be specialised and
further optimised for performance, without the need to significantly
change the logic structure of the initial code.

In brief, the goal of `gyronimo` is to keep maintenance efforts to a
minimum, code readability to its best, and performance to the level that
is really needed by each specific gyromotion application.

#### "What's in a name?", wondered Juliet...

Quite obviously, `gyronimo` is an acronym for GYRO-MOtion. To those with
a sharp eye and an inquisitive mind, the author must confess that he has
absolutely No Idea on how the `ni` managed to sneak into the middle.

Once, in the wild west of yore, Apache warriors were said to charge
their foes shouting "Geronimo!", the nickname of their fierce leader;
Other sources say the same cry was uttered instead by the fleeing
Mexican soldiers, invoking their saint protector "Santo Geronimo";
Whichever the actual cause might have been, library users are expected
to occasionally shout an enthusiastic "gyronimo!" while happily coding
their favorite gyromotion application.

A word about code documentation:
--------------------------------

The source code is extensively documented in order to allow tools like
`doxygen` to easily generate HTML-formatted documentation of the library
API. This procedure ensures up-to-date information at the users finger
tips and potential code contributors are kindly asked to keep it this
way, for the sake of everyone's mental sanity.

Besides the main HTML documentation, there are a number of text files
under the folder `misc/what-why-how` that provide information about some
particular features of `gyronimo` design. Each of these files is
organized in three main sections: what is it (the corresponding feature,
of course), why is it needed for, and how does it work.

Compiling and installing, a minimal and very optimistic howto:
--------------------------------------------------------------

The library requires `cmake` and a c++ compiler supporting the **c++20**
standard (e.g., gcc-10.1.0 or later). If your default compiler does not
follow this requirement, you can choose an alternative one either by
setting the environment variable `CXX=my_c++_compiler` or by providing
the option `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=my_c++_compiler` to `cmake`.

Although `cmake` is usually quite efficient when figuring out the
locations of installed dependency libraries and include files, there are
some circumstances (e.g., multiple installations with different versions
and/or compiler combinations) in which all hints provided are greatly
appreciated. Most often, this goal can be achieved by supplying flags of
the type `-D<my-lib>_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/favourite/my-lib/installation` or
maybe `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/preferred/installation`. For further
details, check the documentation of your particular `cmake` version.

HTML-formatted documentation can be generated from the source code by
`doxygen` if the latter is installed in the target system and support
for it has been explicitly requested by setting `-DSUPPORT_DOXYGEN=ON`.

#### Basic build and install procedure:

1. Run `cmake [options] path/to/gyronimo/repository` on an build folder
   (**outside** the repository) to configure the installation;
2. Run `cmake --build . [options]` to generate the shared library
   `libgyronimo` and any available apps;
3. If configured, run `cmake --build . --target doc` to extract the API
   documentation from source files with `doxygen`;
4. Run `cmake --install . --prefix path/to/install/dir [options]` to
   install include files (prefix/include/gyronimo), shared library
   (prefix/lib), available apps (prefix/bin), and eventual HTML
   documentation (prefix/share/doc/gyronimo);

#### Some useful `cmake` options:

+ `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=my_c++_compiler` selects a specific compiler;
+ `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="flag1 flag2 ..."` provides specific compiler flags;
+ `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE={Release,Debug,Plain}` (default `Release`);
+ `-DSUPPORT_DOXYGEN={ON,OFF}` (default `OFF`);
+ `-DSUPPORT_VMEC={ON,OFF}` (default `OFF`);

After installing, and before using the library, make sure to update
relevant environment variables if the installation folder is not one of
the system's defaults.

External dependencies and other nightmares:
-------------------------------------------

Applications developed using `gyronimo` may, eventually, have to be
compiled and/or linked against the following libraries:

+ [boost](https://www.boost.org), a broad spectrum c++ library;
+ [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl), the GNU scientific library;
+ [netcdf-cxx4](https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-cxx4), a c++ extension
  to NetCDF-4;

Notice, however, that some of the libraries and dependencies listed
above are only required by a given subset of `gyronimo` classes and
functionality. The compilation and installation of the latter can be
controlled by the family `-DSUPPORT_<my_feature>` of `cmake` flags.

A word of caution about external libraries: remember that different c++
compilers will, most likely, mangle class and function names differently
in the object code they produce. Likewise, system calls and the system
libraries they require may also be different. Therefore, it is wise to
ensure that every external c++ library that needs to be linked against
**is compatible** with the compiler version used by `gyronimo` and its
client applications. Users are advised to check the documentation of
their specific software-package manager for details on how to achieve
this goal. A less convenient alternative is to install everything from
scratch using the same c++ compiler version.
