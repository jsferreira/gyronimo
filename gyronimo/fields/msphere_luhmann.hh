//! Simple analytical model of the Earth magnetosphere.
/*!
    Implements a linear combination of a dipole and a current-sheet field [J.
    Luhmann and L. Friesen, J. Geophys. Res. **84**, 4405 (1979)] using
    spherical coordinates where the geocentric distance is normalised to
    `earth_radius` (i.e., @f$\tilde{r} = r/R_E@f$) and the azimuthal angle is
    measured from noon. By default, the field is normalised to
    `earth_surface_avg_field`. The magnitudes of the dipole and current-sheet
    fields may be provided in units of @f$\mathrm{Gauss} \times R_E^3@f$ and
    mGauss respectively, the default (and recommended) values being
    `dipole_factor = 0.31` and `csheet_factor = 0.15`. The current sheet at the
    equatorial plane is smoothed by a tanh function with a `smooth_factor`
    (i.e., @f$\delta@f$) provided in @f$R_E@f$ units. Overall, one has
    @f{equation*}{
      \mathbf{B} =
        d \nabla \biggl(\frac{\cos \theta}{\tilde{r}^2} \biggr) +
        c \tanh \biggl(\frac{\tilde{r} \cos \theta}{\delta} \biggr)
          \mathbf{u}_x
    @f}
    where the versor @f$\mathbf{u}_x@f$ is directed towards the Sun.

    @todo: get rid of the self-built metric and related pointer wizardry.
