//! Tokamak equilibrium magnetic field in 'HELENA' curvilinear coordinates.
/*!
    Following IR3Field rules, the magnetic field is normalised by a `m_factor`
    matching its on-axis value `B0()` in [T], which is located at `R0()` in [m].
    The coordinates are set by the `metric_helena` object and the type of 2d
    interpolators is set by the specific `interpolator2d_factory` supplied.
    Contravariant components have dimensions of [m^{-1}]. Being an
    **equilibrium** field, `t_factor` is set to one.
    
    Only the minimal interface is implemented for the moment and further
    specialisations may enhance the object's performance.
